# My-Debian-Setup
My Debian Linux Setup with dotfiles 

I give my dotfiles for rofi, alacritty etc. u can use these files to customize ur linux :)

Also i added a simple debloat code to GNOME users in debian 
NOTE: my debloat code uninstalls GNOME Software, if u want GNOME Software delete that from code
